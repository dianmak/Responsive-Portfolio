            <br>
            <p>I was born and raised in Jakarta, Indonesia.</p>
            <p>I consider myself one of those people who don't really have a clear cut "home" nation. While this used to
                make me sad, I've come to see that it is a blessing and privilege.
                After graduating cum laude from Tufts University with a Bachelor of Science in Cognitive and Brain
                Sciences, I took a job with CBI as a conference producer in the life
                sciences industry. Prior to graduating, I completed my senior thesis on the effects of caffeine
                consumption on human memory, for which I received High Thesis Honors. At
                CBI, I had the opportunity to work with high-level executives at biopharma companies, conduct market
                research on the most timely topics and problems in the industry, create
                blueprints for the conferences assigned to me and lead a team of sponsorship, logistics, marketing and
                delegate sales colleagues. The last item in my portfolio is a collection
                I designed a few years ago at Parsons School of Design. My immediate goals are to be the best pawrent to
                my dog, to become a life coach within 5 years and to travel as much
                as I can.
